Author: INKling

Humaniform makes your charcter act like a human. When active, it will send
/me messages to sector chat indicating that you're engaged in human-like
activities (every 5 to 20 minutes).

There is a GUI config for you to add or remove custom actions. The token
{its} inside the action will use a possessive pronoun based on the gender
you've configured.

Usage.
------
/humaniform
