Plod
====

Plod can be used to plot courses between two sectors. It will also buy and
unload cargo between two stations, if you provide a third argument. For
trading it will do everything but the flying.

The trade item is case sensitive.

Usage.
------
/plod [start sector or 'current'] [end sector or 'current'] [optional trade item]

Examples:
---------
/plod 'sol e15' 'geira i5' 'XiRite Alloy'
/plod current 'geira o4' 'Basic Targeting Systems'
/plod a12 j6
