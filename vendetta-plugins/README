This repository will have any plugins I write for Vendetta Online. It includes:

Plod -- for moving between two sectors (automatic rerouting) and optionally trading.

Humaniform -- prints human-like activities to sector chat with /me, e.g. /me scratches his head.


====
Plod
====

Plod can be used to plot courses between two sectors. It will also buy and
unload cargo between two stations, if you provide a third argument. For
trading it will do everything but the flying.

The trade item is case sensitive.

Usage.
------
/plod [start sector or 'current'] [end sector or 'current'] [optional trade item]

Examples:
---------
/plod 'sol e15' 'geira i5' 'XiRite Alloy'
/plod current 'geira o4' 'Basic Targeting Systems'
/plod a12 j6



===========
Humaniform.
===========

Humaniform makes your charcter act like a human. When active, it will send
/me messages to sector chat indicating that you're engaged in human-like
activities.

Usage.
------
/humaniform [gender, 'on' or 'off']

Examples.
---------
/humaniform on
/humaniform off
/humaniform male
/humaniform female
